THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Your project should reflect all major learning outcomes from the course modules. There are ‘must have’ core requirements that need to be achieved as a minimum deliverable.

CORE REQUIREMENTS

1.	Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 8 tables. (Both)✔

2.	Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables. (Both) ✔

3.	Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way. (Betty) ✔

4.	In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB. (Anamaria)✔

5.	Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis. (Anamaria) ✔

6.	Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown. (Both) ✔

If you do a group work, you are expected to do all advanced points and produce at least 8 tables in the DB.

ADVANCED OPTIONS

1.	In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs. 	✔

2.	In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs. (Betty) 

3.	In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs. (Anamaria) ✔

4.	Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis. (Betty) ✔

5.	Prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis. (Anamaria) ✔


PROJECT SUBMISSION AND ASSESSMENT
•       Take a backup copy of your diagram, save it as projectname.sql file and submit via Slack channel before the deadline.

•       Your instructor(s) would restore the file on their MySQL server and examine the code.

•       Your instructors would mark it accordingly, then provide comments and feedback on your project.

•       A copy of your project file along with the assessment and comments would be forwarded to CFG to keep a record of and to issue you a certificate, upon successful completion of the project.

•       Every student will be presenting and demonstrating their projects in class during week 8.

To summarise, you need to do both: present the project in class and submit it online. 

PROJECT PRESENTATIONS:

•       Please note that it is possible to be working on a project in groups of two. In this case you can join forces with your classmate and work on the same DB. In this case you would need to take a number of backups and send the updates to each other or store a master copy of the DB on the cloud location e.g. Google Drive.
•       You will have approximately 3 min to do a presentation in class. Start with the DB diagram and explain the idea behind your project, what it is for and how it is expected to be used.
•       Then, run your sample queries to demonstrate how functions, store procedures etc. work. Also show the class few snippets of sample data stored in tables.
•       A quick Q&A about the project at the end of each presentation from your instructors and the group.
